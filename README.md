# Estimation of natural selection and allele age from time series allele frequency data using a novel likelihood-based approach
Source code is implemented for a likelihood-based method for inferring natural selection and allele age from time series data of allele frequencies, and the article has been published in Genetics available at https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.120.303400.

v1.0 includes the source code implemented for the case of constant demographies.

v1.1 includes the source code implemented for the case of non-constant demographies.

There have been some inquiries regarding how to run the R code, which is basically not understandable. We therefore release a web app for the public (see https://fy-bris.github.io/saa-mle/). We’ll release an executable program after we’re sure this version works as expected.
 
Please let us know if you have any feedback. We will correct any bugs in this program in a month or two, and release an updated version.
